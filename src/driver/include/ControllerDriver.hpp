/**
This class controls the behavior of the controller. This is where you
tell OpenVR what your controller has (buttons, joystick, trackpad, etc.).
This is also where you inform OpenVR when the state of your controller
changes (for example, a button is pressed).

For the methods, take a look at the comment blocks for the
ITrackedDeviceServerDriver class too. Those comment blocks have some good
information.

This example driver will simulate a controller that has a joystick and trackpad
on it. It is hardcoded to just return a value for the joystick and trackpad. It
will cause the game character to move forward constantly.

  IVRDriverInput class, but it could return other component classes if it had
  more functionality, such as maybe overlays or UI functionality.
