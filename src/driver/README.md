# SteamVR/OpenVr Driver

This folder houses the driver that will be used to have the quest headset talk to SteamVR/OpenVR.

## Documentation

There will be documentation on how this works and also what I have used to help in the devlopment of this driver, they both will be separated into 2 different parts, I am thinking about getting the GH wiki up that way I can go more idn-depth there instead of here.
