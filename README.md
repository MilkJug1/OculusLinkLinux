# PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE CONTINUING ON

**AT THE MOMENT, THIS DOES NOT WORK..**

Still in development so come back later to see a native build come out, its first going to be on Arch since I develop on it, and then comes the other distros.

Performance will be very poor, since its in its early stage, so come here to submit a issue from a certain game/VR tool and try and commit to this repo.
This may or may not be built in Rust or C/C++, I just gotta decide on which one I want to do. Also a Discord Server is coming soon!

There is 3 main different branches that have their own code base, it goes as followed: Main-> Similar to the C/CPP branch, just more Stable. This branch will be the least messed with. C/CPP: Just the same as main but more unstable and has more experimental features.
Then the 3rd branch, Rust, is this whole project written in Rust. This branch hasn't been touched but after the c++ implementation, I will update the Rust branch to work.

This Open-Source Project is trying to get Oculus Quest link(Meta link?) working on Linux, since there is no support for Oculus drivers on Linux.

### Requirements

The full list of requirements is in the [Requirements](./INFO/Requirements.md) folder.

### Socials

![Discord Banner 3](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/936065347218448415/widget.png?style=banner3)

I finally got the Discord Sever up, its a bit barebones, but it will be a place for people to chat about the project, and also to discuss the project. An icon for the server is coming too.
