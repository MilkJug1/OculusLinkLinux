**THIS ONLY WORKS FOR THE RUST BRANCH, IF YOU ARE NOT ON THE RUST BRANCH, PLEASE GO TO IT. DOES NOT WORK ATM FOR THE C/CPP BRANCH, AND PARTLY THE MAIN.**

# OculusLinkLinux
This Open-Source Project is trying to get Oculus Quest link(Meta link?) working on Linux, since there is no support for Oculus drivers on Linux. 

**AT THE MOMENT, THIS DOES NOT WORK..**

Still in development so come back later to see a native build come out, its first going to be on Arch since I develop on it, and then comes the other distros. 

Performace will be very poor, since its in its early stage, so come here to submit a issue from a certain game/VR tool and try and commit to this repo.
This may or may not be built in Rust or C/C++, I just gotta decide on which one I want to do. Also a Discord Server is coming soon!

*note: this may be packaged as a flatpak in order for every else to use it, but im not sure if the whole thing will work smoohtly. Mainly expect Arch to be the most stable, and be weary of the other distros binary of this since it may be less stable.*



**LOOK HERE FOR INFO PLEASE**
THIS HAS BEEN MODIFIED SO THAT THERE IS 2 DIFFERENT BRANCHES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN THINGS, THE "c/cpp" and "rust" NEITHER ARE THE MAIN BRANCH, BUT ARE GOING TO BE MADE TOGETHER, C/CPP WILL BE THE MOST UPDATED WHILE THE RUST BRANCH MAY BE THE MOST STABLE.
