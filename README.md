# OculusLinkLinux
This Open-Source Project is trying to get Oculus Quest link(Meta link?) working on Linux, since there is no support for Oculus drivers on Linux. 

**AT THE MOMENT, THIS DOES NOT WORK..**

Still in development so come back later to see a native build come out, its first going to be on Arch since I develop on it, and then comes the other distros. 

Performace will be very poor, since its in its early stage, so come here to submit a issue from a certain game/VR tool and try and commit to this repo.
This may or may not be built in Rust or C/C++, I just gotta decide on which one I want to do. Also a Discord Server is coming soon!
