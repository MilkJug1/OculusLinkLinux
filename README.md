# OculusLinkLinux
This Open-Source Project is trying to get Oculus Quest link(Meta link?) working on Linux, since there is no support for Oculus drivers on Linux. 


Still in development so come back later to see a native build come out, its first going to be on Arch since I develop on it, and then comes the other distros. 

Performace will be very poor, since its in its early stage, so come here to submit a issue from a certain game/VR tool and try and commit to this repo.
