# TODO

1. Rewrite the entirety of all .md files since most of them are written badly.

2. Figure out how Quest Dev works, and develop and android app in order to interface with this app and the computer.
  - Maybe figure out how to root after this, prob not possible but is something im focused on.


3. Figure out documentation, and write most of it in the code, and then put in on github wiki.

4. Fix issues with compiling and also fix include issues with OpenXR.
  - Top priority since it would help fix #7 and #18 , since those are kinda important.


5. Clean out useless and unessecary files and folders (looking at you `build/`) in all branches.
  - ~Update the [Install.md](./Install.md) to support the removial of the `build/` dir.~ - Done in this commit.


6. Create a *somewhat* good UI for the app.

7. Figure out how to have the UI interface with the app.

8. Actually use the libraries that I included.

9. See if i can open the Oculus Quest via usb, hopefully that would mean we won't need an app.
