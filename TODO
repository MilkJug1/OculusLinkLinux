Todo:
    ☐ Figure out if this should be build in rust or in C. Not really sure at the moment. Prob Rust for the moment
    Note, find a way to get the base working and then modify ALVR so that it makes it easier to do.
    Also find a way to make custom libraries so that this makes it easier to work on.
    

    ☐ Add functionality for checking for the quest connection, like from usb @started(21-12-28 12:34)
        ☐ If is done, make sure to send trackers and other info over so that steam VR can use them for games

    ☐ Find a way to get the Quest Prompt to appear, at this point I may have to do it from a application
        Ways: 
            ☐ from a modified version of ALVR, found here: https://github.com/MilkJug1/ALVR
            ☐ or try either emulating the way that Oculus link handles it, like drivers, etc; and then try to connect the quest
            from there.
