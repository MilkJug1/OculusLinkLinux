# Requirements

- Be on a x64 Linux desktop, no ARM support.

- HAVE A PC THAT CAN ACTUALLY RUN THE VR GAME YOU ARE TRYING TO PLAY.
If you do not know the minimum requirements to use SteamVR, [please consolidate the SteamVR page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/). Please note that you also will need to check the specific game's minimum requirements to see if it will actually work.

> **Note**
> Please make sure that proton actively, or has support for the VR game you are trying to play.
> There are few of these, and fewer of VR games that natively support Linux.

- Make sure that drivers for you PC components are up to date.

> **Warning**
> I don't know if future Nvidia drivers will break how this will work, and also other Linux games.
> If you have a Nvidia card(Like me!), and you are experiencing issues with using OLfL, make sure to downgrade your driver to see if it will help it. Otherwise, make an issue here.

Plus, for the people that own and use an NVIDIA card, please note that performance may be degraded a bit playing VR games with an Nvidia GPU, as it has been reported that NVIDIA cards have had issues with SteamVR.

- Have a USB3 or greater port and have a USB3 or greater cable, a speed test to see if your cable is good or not will be coming soon.

- Have both Conan and SteamVR both installed.

> **Note** if you do not have Conan installed, please follow the tutorial in the [Install.md](Install.md) file.
