What you need in order to for this to work is:
- Be on Linux (obv, also should work on all kernels and kernel versions)

- HAVE A PC THAT CAN ACTUALLY RUN THE VR GAME YOU ARE TRYING TO PLAY 

- Own and have the Quest (or Quest 2) plugged in. (If this has a seperate android app, sideload that into the quest)

- Have SteamVR installed and run it when you launch it

-OpenXR installed on your Linux Distro

# Building from source
 - Have the OpenXR SDK either from Oculus or from Kronos themselves. (Either should work)
