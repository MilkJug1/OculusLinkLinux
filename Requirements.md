# Requirements

- Be on a x64 Linux desktop, no ARM support.

- HAVE A PC THAT CAN ACTUALLY RUN THE VR GAME YOU ARE TRYING TO PLAY.

> **Note**
> Please make sure that proton actively, or has support for the VR game you are trying to play.
> There are few of these, and fewer of VR games that natively support Linux.

- Make sure that drivers for you PC components are up to date.

> **Warning**
> I don't know if future Nvidia drivers will break how this will work, and also other Linux games.
> If you have a Nvidia card(Like me!), and you are experenicing issues with using OLfL, make sure to downgrade your driver to see if it will help it. Otherwise, make an issue here.

- Have a working USB 3 port with a USB 3 compatible cable, a speed test to see if your cable is good or not will be coming soon.

- Have both Conan and SteamVR both installed.

> **Note** if you do not have Conan installed, please follow the tutorial in the [Install.md](Install.md) file.
